# Restrictions (should not do)

Rules derived from **decisions already reflected** in the Grim backend repo. They reduce drift and duplicate sources of truth.

## Layout and dead structure

- **Do not** recreate removed top-level `src/` buckets for this service unless there is a deliberate new design and a doc update: there is no `src/domain/`, `src/errors/`, `src/config/`, `src/providers/`, `src/repositories/`, `src/services/`, `src/http/`, or `src/lib/` in the current tree.
- **Do not** leave empty directories after moves; remove them so the tree matches reality.

## Types and contracts

- **Do not** define a second parallel home for the same shapes that already live in `api/v1/model/` (e.g. duplicate `GrimUpload` or `ExportListItem` in random folders). Extend or import from the model layer.
- **Do not** move `ApiError` back under `src/errors/` without updating every consumer; the canonical file is `libs/utils/api-error.util.ts`.

## Application wiring

- **Do not** split production wiring across multiple entry modules without a clear reason: production dependency construction lives in **`server.ts`** next to `loadServerEnv` and `createApp` (there is no `dependencies.ts`).
- **Do not** bypass `createApp` for the main server path; avoid spinning up a second parallel Express app for the same process without a documented reason.

## HTTP layers

- **Do not** put import pipeline orchestration or export listing logic only inside `routes/*.ts` or `controllers/*.ts` when it belongs in `services/` (keep routes/controllers thin, as with existing import/export/health code).
- **Do not** skip `wrapAsync` on new async handlers attached to the same error middleware unless you handle errors another explicit way.

## Configuration

- **Do not** read required process env ad hoc in random modules for values already defined on `ServerEnv` in `libs/configs/env.config.ts` — load once and pass dependencies where needed.
- **Do not** hardcode export/import byte limits outside `libs/constants/limits.contant.ts` unless you intentionally change the single source and its consumers.

## Accuracy

- **Do not** document file paths or behaviors in `docs/` that contradict `backend/src/` or `backend/openapi.yaml` without updating the code or the spec to match.

## Tests

- **Do not** treat **`backend/test/unit-test/libs/**`** as optional when you add or change **`backend/src/libs/**`**; keep the mirror paths and **`.test.ts`** naming described in **`docs/code-rules/unit-test-rules.md`**.
- **Do not** make **`test/app.test.ts`** (or other **`createApp`** suites) depend on real **`LLM_API_KEY`** (or legacy provider aliases), Firebase, or Cloudinary unless that is an explicit, documented exception—**`unit-test-rules.md`** splits app doubles vs lib integration.
- **Do not mock** Cloudinary, Firebase Realtime Database, or other **storage / DB** clients in **`test/unit-test/libs/**`** when testing those adapters—use **real** services with **`backend/.env`**.
- **Do not** leave integration test data in Cloudinary or RTDB (or any paid store): **always delete or destroy** what the test created, including in **`finally`** so teardown runs if an assertion fails mid-test. See **`docs/code-rules/unit-test-rules.md`** → **Storage and database**.

## Note on constants filename

- The limits module is currently named **`limits.contant.ts`** (typo). Do not silently “fix” the filename in one place without updating all imports and any documentation that reference the path.
